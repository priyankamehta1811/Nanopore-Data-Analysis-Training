# Nanopore-Data-Analysis-Training
This is a step-by-step tutorial for performing Nanopore data analysis for beginner data analysts 

This tutorial is specifically for SARS-CoV-2 genomic data analysis using Artic-protocol

We will cover the steps from transferring the data from minit to generating the consensus fasta which can be future used for downstream studies like phylogenetic analysis and mutational/epidemiological studies.
